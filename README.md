## 📝 Writing Tests

Mobile apps are used by billions of users worldwide across diverse devices, operating systems, and network environments. Ensuring that your mobile app performs flawlessly under different scenarios is essential for delivering a positive user experience and maintaining customer satisfaction. Mobile app testing helps identify and resolve issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of defects reaching end-users.
